# Digital_Marketing_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI), Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Lead (CPL), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Conversion Rates.

Using a dataset that tracks marketing expenditures and campaign performance, this analysis provides insights into which campaigns, locations, and time periods drive the best results.

📌 Key Questions Addressed:

1️⃣ What is the overall Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)?

2️⃣ How do different campaigns perform in terms of revenue and ROMI?

3️⃣ On which dates did we spend the most money, earn the highest revenue, and see significant changes in conversion rates?

4️⃣ Do buyers behave differently on weekdays vs. weekends?

5️⃣ Which marketing campaign type (social, banner, influencer, or search) generates the best results?

6️⃣ Which geo-locations (Tier 1, Tier 2) yield better returns?
